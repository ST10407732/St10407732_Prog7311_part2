## Overview

The **Agri-Energy Connect Platform** is a prototype web application designed to connect farmers with energy and agricultural services through a centralized system. This enterprise-level solution demonstrates advanced software development practices and implements role-based functionality for **Farmers** and **Employees**. The platform serves as a digital ecosystem where farmers can manage their agricultural products while employees can oversee farmer registrations and monitor product listings.

## Key Features

- **Role-Based Authentication**: Secure login system with separate interfaces for Farmers and Employees
- **Farmer Management**: Employees can add and manage farmer accounts
- **Product Management**: Farmers can add and showcase their agricultural products
- **Advanced Filtering**: Search products by date range, farmer name, or product category
- **Responsive Design**: User-friendly interface built with Bootstrap and Razor views

## User Roles

The platform supports two primary user roles:

1. **Employee**: System administrators who can:
   - Register new farmers into the system
   - View products from all farmers
   - Filter products by date range, farmer name, or category
   
2. **Farmer**: Agricultural producers who can:
   - Manage their product listings
   - Add new products to the marketplace
   - View their own product listings

## Technology Stack

- **Framework**: ASP.NET Core 8.0 MVC
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Bootstrap
- **Backend**: C#, Entity Framework Core
- **Database**: Microsoft SQL Server Express/LocalDB
- **Authentication**: ASP.NET Core Identity
- **Architecture**: Layered MVC architecture with Repository Pattern

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

### Essential Software Requirements
- **Visual Studio 2022** or later
- **.NET 8.0 SDK** or later
- **SQL Server Express** or **LocalDB**
- **Entity Framework Core** tools

### Additional Requirements
- **Git**: For version control and cloning the repository
- **Internet Connection**: Required for downloading NuGet packages

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

Open a command prompt or terminal and execute the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ST10407732/St10407732_Prog7311_part2.git
cd St10407732_Prog7311_part2
```

### 2. Database Configuration

Follow these steps to set up your database:

#### Step 2.1: Create the Database
1. Open SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)
2. Connect to your SQL Server instance
3. Right-click on "Databases" in the Object Explorer
4. Select "New Database..."
5. Enter `AgriConnectDb` as the database name
6. Click "OK" to create the database

#### Step 2.2: Update Connection String
1. Open the `appsettings.json` file in the project root directory
2. Locate the `ConnectionStrings` section
3. Update the `DefaultConnection` to match your SQL Server instance name:

```json
"ConnectionStrings": {
  "DefaultConnection": "Server=(localdb)\\mssqllocaldb;Database=AgriConnectDb;Trusted_Connection=True;MultipleActiveResultSets=true"
}
```

Replace `(localdb)\\mssqllocaldb` with your actual SQL Server instance name if you're not using LocalDB.

**Note for SQL Server Authentication**: If you're using SQL Server Authentication instead of Windows Authentication, update your connection string accordingly:

```
"DefaultConnection": "Server=YourServerName;Database=AgriConnectDb;User Id=YourUsername;Password=YourPassword;MultipleActiveResultSets=true;TrustServerCertificate=True"
```

### 3. Apply Database Migrations

This step will create all necessary database tables and seed initial data:

#### Option A: Using Visual Studio Package Manager Console
1. Open the solution file (`AgriEnergyPlatform.sln`) in Visual Studio
2. Open the Package Manager Console from: Tools > NuGet Package Manager > Package Manager Console
3. Ensure the Default project is set to the main project
4. In the console, execute the following commands:
   ```
   Add-Migration InitialCreate
   Update-Database
   ```
5. Wait for the commands to complete - you should see "Done." message

#### Option B: Using Command Line Interface (CLI)
1. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal
2. Execute the following commands:
   ```bash
   dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate
   dotnet ef database update
   ```
3. Wait for the commands to complete successfully

### 4. Install Required NuGet Packages

The project depends on several NuGet packages. If they aren't automatically restored:

#### Using Visual Studio:
1. Right-click on the solution in Solution Explorer
2. Select "Restore NuGet Packages"
3. Wait for the process to complete

#### Using Command Line:
```bash
dotnet restore
```

### 5. Build and Run the Application

#### Option A: Using Visual Studio
1. Open the solution file (`AgriEnergyPlatform.sln`) in Visual Studio
2. Build the solution: Press Ctrl+Shift+B or select Build > Build Solution
3. Run the application: Press F5 or click the green "Play" button
4. Your default browser should open automatically with the application running

#### Option B: Using Command Line
```bash
dotnet build
dotnet run
```

The application should now be running at the localhost address specified in your browser.

### 6. Verify Database Setup

To ensure your database has been correctly set up:
1. Open SQL Server Management Studio
2. Connect to your database server
3. Expand the `AgriConnectDb` database
4. Expand the "Tables" folder
5. Verify that all necessary tables have been created

If the tables don't exist, try repeating Step 3 of the setup process.
